THIS PROJECT DOES NOT USE FLASK!!!

This is a FastAPI project.
It is a web application that provides a RESTful API for handling xtream codes.
The project uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions and Pydantic for data validation.
The main functionalities include user authentication, managing streams, and handling EPG data.

Package management is handled using uv, don't use pip.

Don't go overboard with the comments, only comment stuff that is not obvious.

All id columns in database tables should be guid.

You should have deep knowledge of xtream codes and xmltv formats to work on this project.
